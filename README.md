+### My Guessing Game
+
+If you know me, you know I love sports and my favorite sport is 
+basketball! And who better to make a guessing game after none other
+than the legendary Michael Jordan! The game starts out by alerting
+the user that a guessing game is about to commence based on Michael
+Jordan's championship rings. The user is then prompted to enter a
+number between 1-10 and see if they can guess the right amount of
+hardware Michael Jordan posseses. The answer to the question is 6
+championship rings. If the user's guess is equal to 6, the message
+that appears is "Wow you got it!". If they guess wrong, the message
+"Nope! Sorry!" comes up. That simple.

Added functionality to ask users their name and then use that information in question,
program now also asks if they want to try again if they answer incorrectly, if they say
yes they can answer again or they can say no and exit. The program still ends if they
get the answer right on the first try.
