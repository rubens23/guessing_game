		<h2>Like Mike</h2>
			<p>Michael Jeffrey Jordan was the greatest basketball player to ever live. He spent most of his career with the Chicago Bulls winning multiple championships
			and being regarded as one of the greatest athletes in the history of sports.
			He had a very successful and storied career, one that most athletes can only dream of. He is an idol in all of our eyes causing us to hope that one day we can be 'Like Mike'.
